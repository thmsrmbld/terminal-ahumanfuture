## Babe, you know I'm trying to make a change

For six weeks I have been buying my bread from a woman named Tatjana who makes 15 loaves at a time
from the micro-bakery operation in the kitchen of her home. She bakes twice a week, on Tuesdays and
Fridays. You need to remember that you want bread for the week and order it three days before bake
day. You choose from a small collection of hand-made, traditional European-style sourdough loaves
and you pay a tiny amount extra to have them delivered to your home in person, by her. More often
than not, they turn up warm from the oven. It is fantastic bread made by a gifted and skilled human
being who makes one thing and really cares about that thing being outstanding.

The poisonous tumour installed in my brain by a decade of reading about Silicon Valley always thinks
'this is a business that can never scale' and it's like well yes that is the fucking point actually.

It is curious that in 2025 in the United Kingdom it somehow feels like some sort of act of radical
localism to buy a food item with a 30,000 year history made by a business that is not currently
listed on the stock exchange. Maybe this says more about me than other people, though. Personally,
buying bread from an organisation listed on the stock exchange is one of the many things that does
in fact make me think deeply about what the Fuck we are doing as a society a lot of the time now and
why exactly we have backed ourselves into the many seemingly-inescapable corners that we have.

I love bread, but buying this bread is mostly about arriving embarrassingly late to the party of
trying to act practically on the idea that the world is just what we decide that it will be, and
that it is malleable, and that nothing is inevitable. In short, I am now trying really hard to spend
my money in ways that I hope will affect and improve the world around me both for myself and for
others. None of us can do it alone. But I think
<a href="https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/we-all-have-a-choice/" target="_blank">there is hope if we do
it together</a>.

#### It's all upside down

I think it's more common than one might realise to slowly and unintentionally build habits that you
did not consciously choose, and eventually strike moments that make you gaze upon your life
wondering how they came to be. Despite a quiet but growing feeling of latent dread about many of my
own consumption behaviours (drifted well beyond what I would have chosen if faced with all of the
same choices today), I _still_ spent too long giving myself permission to ignore the implications of
spending much of my personal income with some of the worst companies on planet earth. It did,
however, always feel clear to me that I was going to eventually have to correct this. Especially
given their growing and frankly, cartoon-villain levels of civic abuse committed every day, although
many of them barely existed just 20 years ago. But unfortunately, moral bankruptcy happens the same
way as actual bankruptcy; slowly, and then all at once. These institutions rely on the convenience
of their respective market shares; hacked out and bankrolled over years by a near infinite amount of
subscription cash and indefatigable venture runway. They are relying on it eventually becoming too
cumbersome to move away and their market dominance leaving only limited, expensive or inconvenient
replacements for the deeply unethical services you have, by then, invested years of your time and
money in. Over years, these companies leech into all of the corners of your consumer life. The power
that this continued endorsement grants them transforms them quietly into giant political and
economic influencers that shape every detail of the reality we are doing a shockingly poor job of
learning to occupy harmoniously.

In a surprise to few, it turns out designing an economy around the whims of the owners of
organisations that exist as vehicles for an insatiable appetite for money has left us with the
outcomes you might expect. The world's richest 1% own just more than 50% of its generated wealth.
The wealthiest 10% control around 85% of it. It is an astonishing, upside-down cake of inequality of
now monumental proportions.

## Spotify's purpose is to transport hundreds of millions of dollars created by musicians into the bank accounts of the owners of humanity's most advanced autonomous weapons platforms

Following the wisdom that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does" target="_blank">a
system is what it does</a>, Spotify in 2025 is a computer system that converts the huge mountains of
money that musicians generate using their creative gifts into an astonishing net worth for it's
billionaire founder, so he can deploy it with his separate
<a href="https://primamateria.com/" target="_blank">investment company</a> in leading a
<a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250704-spotify-ceo-investments-700m-in-ai-drone-weapons-company-as-artists-call-for-boycott/" target="_blank">$700
million dollar investment round</a> in cutting-edge autonomous weapons companies.

Spotify, prior to this, were already well established as the market-dominant streaming service that
pays easily the worst per-stream artist royalty rate **($0.003 to $0.005)** in the industry. As a
music company, this should already be mortifying, and more than enough reason for all of their users
to find another service. But perhaps unsurprisingly, the person who founded what I personally think
might be one of the most artist-exploitative multimedia companies in technology history is
unperturbed by the order left designed; sufficient that the revenue extracted from the global artist
community that provide the platform's _only_ meaningful product is now, with some intermediary
steps, relocated to places like the bank accounts of German weapons companies. The weapons companies
then give that money to some of the world's most academically accomplished people who have come to
the remarkable conclusion that the best use of their talent and their single blessed lifetime on
this miracle of a planet is to design modern warfare's most advanced assault drones.

Listen I'm just saying I guess I wouldn't do it myself and also that it's a dynamic that feels like
a nightmare. And that it's an interesting thing because it's one type of thing to nakedly dump your
money into these companies for a return. It's another entirely to run a music company that is in
fact a sort of cash extraction fan sat in the unexpected chasm between musicians desperate to make
money from the discovery of their own art, and ambitious venture capitalists hoping to make money
from the brutal economics of war. Look I'm not saying that Spotify makes the weapons or even owns
the stake, because that would not be true. I'm sadly not even saying that today, we don't need
weapons companies, which is just a very horrible thing itself. I'm just saying that the business
guys who got richer than your mind can ever imagine by controlling access to almost all of today's
music now pay a lot of science guys to make robot weapons. People who actually go to war are often
haunted by the memory of the constant overhead sound of drones by the way and if they do get to come
back home a lot of them don't talk about it much after. The ones I have personally met do however
love music.

Which I guess is why it's a jarring thing to think that subscribers do now pay £9.99 a month for a
service that is whether they like it or not implicated in the future of products such as the
<a href="https://helsing.ai/europa" target="_blank">CA-1 Europa Autonomous Uncrewed Combat Aerial
Vehicle</a> or the <a href="https://helsing.ai/lura" target="_blank">SG-1 + Lura Underwater
Autonomous Mass</a> and I personally think that subsurface surveillance patrol swarms are a thing
that I should not be worried about when I just want to listen to Chicago's finest hardcore band
<a href="https://www.harmsway13.eu/" target="_blank"> Harm's Way</a>. And that when the band make me
feel like something deep in my spirit is roaring with knowing and understanding and satisfaction,
when they drive yet another thunderous, wailing rhythm section, that their artistry should somehow
cross over into the area of drone manufacture is a profoundly perverse outcome. Or similarly, when I
listen to anything by South London jazz royalty
<a href="https://song.link/i/1670391324" target="_blank">Venna</a>, and his delicate saxophone lines
wrap around me like the sunlight of a never-ending dream of being in love in Barcelona. And I feel
the warmth of Rocco Palladino's rich, wandering basslines just shimmer over my skin, like some sort
of golden blanket. When those notes make the hair on my arms stand up I don't want to have anything
to do with Helsing's <a href="https://helsing.ai/hx-2" target="_blank">HX-2 – AI Strike Drone</a>
even if it has a 100km operator range and is immune to hostile electronic warfare measures even
without a consistent data connection. But what do I know I'm just some fuckin' guy blogging about
bread.

So it's like I said. It's like the bread. It all does in fact make me think deeply about what the
Fuck we are doing as a society a lot of the time now and why exactly we have backed ourselves into
what once felt like many previously-escapable corners.

## Perfect divide, gentle change

Because of all of that weird shit, I felt I had to leave Spotify behind, which felt oddly emotional
and psychologically difficult because I listen to at least 30 hours of music a week and had curated
something like 350 custom playlists from nothing over 9 years. Turns out it was
<a href="https://soundiiz.com/" target="_blank">practically, pretty easy</a> though, which is like
any of the countless tasks that I think about for 4 full months and then just do in one evening,
including
<a href="/posts/2025-03-12/i-launched-this-little-blog-on-11ty-and-i-am-excited-about-it/" target="_blank">building
this website</a>. I left Spotify for <a href="https://tidal.com/" target="_blank">Tidal</a>. Tidal
is unfortunately also a different sort of music theft company of its own, owned by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block,_Inc" target="_blank">Block</a>, but it pays artists
almost 4 times what Spotify does, the sound quality is higher and it isn't absolutely packed with
new, nonsense features that I hate. I've also since bought four records on
<a href="https://bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>, which is the first time in a long time
I've actually bought music directly from the artist and I'm mostly going to commit to doing more of
that. I've also bought a piece of merchandise at every single concert I've been to since, even if
small, which is hands-down the best way to support your artists.

I guess I'm focusing on Spotify a lot, but it's not really even about Spotify individually.

I used the forward motion to also start to try to get a grip on the other ways I've been leaning on
companies that everyone knows are getting away with doing very bad stuff. I used to shop constantly
at Amazon. I cancelled Prime pretty much immediately and haven't spent any money at Amazon retail in
six weeks, which is very significant, relative to what I was doing for the decade prior. It turns
out you can just find loads of small businesses near you selling the same thing for almost the same
price. It doesn't arrive the next day, but we need to get serious about whether or not the
ecological and economic decimation caused by Amazon is worth the benefit of receiving things like
candles 12 hours after you order them. I moved my side projects off of, and cancelled, my Vercel
account. I'd already left Twitter a long time ago, despite being active on there for 13 years, and
Facebook is just a place where I log in every few months to get something second-hand off of
Marketplace. I've been trying mostly to shop outside of huge national chains for perishable foods
like fruits and vegetables. I've been buying second-hand Blu-rays for like £1 each, and beginning
the rebuild of my physical media library. I've been buying my bread from Tatjana.

I think there's a sad and predictable response to an attempt to do better in an environment where
individuals alone cannot make the difference they want to be able to due to the overwhelming power
of oligopoly. A number of people have fairly gleefully (?) told me that not shopping at Amazon
doesn't change anything because AWS powers 35% of the Internet, like I don't already fucking know
what a dismal situation that is. A few have told me things like "they're all doing bad stuff", and
the worst of all of this shit is "there's no ethical consumption under capitalism". Like, so what?
Even if that _is_ true, so what? You get to write yourself permission to default to the lowest
common denominator shit possible and that that's not behaviour that shapes collective incentive?
It's the same school of thought of 'well, if I don't do Bad Thing X, someone else just will anyway'.
The correct response to that is 'let it be them'. It's a manoeuvre and it's a transparent line of
shit and even I knew that for all the years I was ignoring it myself.

I haven't been talked down to by anybody else who is also making their own gentle change. The same
way that you rarely get shit on by somebody doing better than you at anything.

This consistent misread is that no positive change is worth making unless you make it in a pristine,
completely consistent, platonic final form. No. Not only is this characteristic of the main problem
of progressivism today, this is also fundamentally untrue. No change is made in a vacuum, and no
step forward in history comes perfectly. Believing it _is_ true extricates you from your own
responsibility and your own autonomy. It reduces your individual volition and humanity to a tool of
large business. It is obedience in advance. It is an obscene mode of infantilism and not an honest
position. And it reminds me of the total truism, the necessity of accepting that you won't be
perfect, and that's fine: _"And now that you do not have to be perfect, you can be good."_

These are small moves, and something I hope to expand upon as I find ways to interact more
intentionally with the technology industry over time. But I would really like to invite you to the
same beginning of your own small changes in the ways that your own life and mind can afford. Because
it _does_ matter. This is not about an attempt to kill certain companies. It's less naive, and
quieter, and more pragmatic than that. It's about _nourishing_ others as if they are living like you
are, as a practical movement towards using our collective power to grow a world we intentionally
want to see more of. It is about a world that positively blooms around us because we are committing
to the quiet and constant and careful work of tending to it.

On a parting note, I leave you with two of the greatest to do it:

<blockquote>
  "The ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and 
  could just as easily make differently." - David Graeber
</blockquote>

And:

<blockquote>
  "But love doesn't just sit there like a stone; it has to be made, like bread, 
  remade all the time, made new." - Ursula Le Guin
</blockquote>

For now, I am wishing you the best music you have ever heard in a world where the artists are paid
handsomely for the joy that they break apart your misery, and mundanity, and pain with.

Until tomorrow. 🕶 🖤
