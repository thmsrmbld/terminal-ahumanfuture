Hello! I'm Thomas, and I'm a computer programmer and creative based in and around the city of
London. My favourite things are arts and creativity, and making excellent things with people who
love to do the same.

Professionally, I've
<span class="dash-link"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasrumbold" target="_blank">worked</a></span>
in numerous hands-on, hands-off,and leadership capacities, having been Online since I was
12-years-old. I feel strongly about an Internet for Good and am interested in creating things that
fall naturally into that space.

I am also interested in pizza, photography, film, heavy metal, tattoos and the kinds of
counterculture where people are naturally rewarded for being their most creative, collaborative,
expressive and authentic selves.

Drop me a message if you fancy a chat. I always like mail. :)
